This repository hosts the contents for my [website](https://jiayuanWen.github.io), such as projects shown in Projects page and blogs.

This is my attempt at working around the drawback that GitHub Pages only supports static contents and no support for databases/datastores, such as MongoDB, Google Cloud SQL, etc.
